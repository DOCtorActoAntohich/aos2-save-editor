# `easydiff`

A stupid crate intended for comparing binary files.

Here's what you're supposed to do with it.

1. Backup the savefile.
2. Do something in the game to change some fields.
3. Compare backup to the changed file.
4. Figure out what fields do.

Make sure to run this command to see how to use the app.

```bash
cargo run -- --help
```
